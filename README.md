# 🧠 Python ML | DL | AI | NLP Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository for Python-based Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.

This repo serves as:
- A backup of my progress ✅
- A tracker of my journey from beginner to advanced 💡
- A clean collection of notes, code, and mini-projects 🚀

## 🎯 Learning Plan

| Phase       | Topics                             | Status     |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| Phase 1     | Python Core (syntax, OOP, pandas)  | ✅ Done     |
| Phase 2     | Machine Learning (Sklearn)         | 🔄 Ongoing  |
| Phase 3     | Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)   | 🔜 Next     |
| Phase 4     | NLP (text, embeddings, transformers) | 🔜 Soon   |
| Phase 5     | AI Concepts (agents, search, RL)   | 🔜 Coming   |
